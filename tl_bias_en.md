# Counter-intuitive concepts

## Company is more interested in developers’ growth, learning and education

Developers work is essential for company’s prosperity.

Better the developers are, more the company can achieve.

Companies rarely split profits equally between employees, more often developers get minor share of the profits.

This means in that companies have stronger financial incentives to get developers to learn, grow and improve than developers themselves.

Hence, if developers ask you to allocate time for learning, you’re doing something wrong — you as a manager should have been proactive in encouraging them to grow.

## Plan developer’s “leave” before hiring

Company loses money whenever a developer leaves: you need to source a replacement, onboard her and it will anyway take some time till she becomes as productive as the one who left.

Developer survives stressful times as well — she is looking for a new job (often while still working at your company), passes interviews, hesitates, etc. And in intellectual work productivity suffers in stressful conditions.

Replacing a developer usually costs from 1/6 to her full annual salary, but what’s worse — more suddenly she leaves, more the replacement might cost.

Some companies monitor developer’s CV updates on the job sites believing that they will be able to react to those updates and “retain” a developer.

However, it’s highly likely that most of your developers are constantly approached by recruiters directly, so the only reliable source of information is the developer herself.

It’s also quite risky to assume that a developer will come discuss that she’s considering leaving — trust is built, not assumed. And asking a developer something like “please come talk if you’re about to leave” is _not_ building trust :)

The most effective way to make a topic “discussable” is for the manager to initiate discussion as early as possible and by not just stating some common words, but by showing that the manager welcomes the discussion and plans it much before it occurs.

The easiest way to plan developer’s leave is to show what takeaway package she will have when she leaves.

The takeaway package will contain all her growth log, achievements and development participation history.

## Adding more people to the team slows team performance



## Metrics and targets hurt performance

## Diversity over standards

Diversity provides wider pool of options to choose from.

arguing, conflicts — only constructive
can a conflict be constructive?

## processes and approaches once decided should be often reconsidered to check if they still give value
