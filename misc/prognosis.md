# Quality of prognosis

When we say "feature A will take X days", we are providing a prognosis of time the team will spend to deliver the feature.

What do we take into consideration when providing such prognosis?

1. Uncertainty of the feature itself:
   - what the desired behaviour is (requirements are)
   - how we plan to change our system to match new requirements
2. Uncertainty of the world and people
   - who will be changing the system to match new requirements
   - if they possess enough knowledge and skills to perform changes
   - if they will actually be present to perform the changes
   - if they will actually want to perform the changes
   - if they will possess enough resources to perform the changes (nothing blocking, enough information present)

It seems obvious that 
The quality of this prognosis obviously depends on how much effort we spend in reducing the uncertainty in the feature.

We cannot guarantee the accuracy of the prognosis
