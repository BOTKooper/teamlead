# Regular 1-1 meetings rationalisation

I’ve asked many teamleads why they have regular 1-1s.

By regular I mean set in the calendar to occur regularly.

Rationale is as follows:
- employees need time to bring and discuss problems they witnessed
- some problems need to be solved straight away and some can wait
- employees need not to be afraid to discuss problems
- manager need not to forget to provide feedback to employees

I’ll try to analyse each rationalisation attempt.
