# Regular 1-1 meetings rationalisation

Iâ€™ve asked many teamleads why they have regular 1-1s.

Rationale is as follows:
- employees need time to bring and discuss problems they witnessed
- employees need not to be afraid to discuss problems
- manager need not to forget to provide feedback to employees
