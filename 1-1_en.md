# Regular 1-1 meetings rationalisation

I’ve asked many teamleads why they have regular 1-1s.

By regular I mean set in the calendar to occur regularly.

Usual rationale is as follows:
- employees need time to bring and discuss problems they witnessed
- some problems need to be solved straight away and some can wait
- employees need not to be afraid to discuss problems
- manager need not to forget to provide feedback to employees

I’ll try to analyse each rationalisation attempt.

## Employees need time to bring and discuss problems

One cannot possibly argue that time is required to discuss a problem and come up with ways to solve it.

However, it’s important to focus on «when» the problem is discussed.

If 1-1 occurs every two weeks, the problem will have to wait from 1 till 13 days to be resolved.

Is this optimal? I doubt.

Usual counter-argument here is that «urgent» problems are resolved straight away while «other problems» wait.

This approach implies having whole team adopt good «triage» strategy for problems which allows everyone to properly separate problems based on their severity.

Triage demands possessing enough information to decide on problem’s category.

Do your developers know how to triage problems? Do they have enough information to triage problems?

...

## Employees need not to be afraid to discuss problems

## Manager need not to forget to provide feedback to employees

It seems to be obvious: no feedback — no improvement.

Employees should provide feedback for their results as soon as the results occur — if feedback is postponed, its value is almost null.

When result is not what was expected, you want next tasks to be done in a way that will yield results satisfying the expectations, so it’s clear the feedback should be given with no delay.

Hence, regular 1-1s fail to achieve this goal here.
