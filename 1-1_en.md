# Regular 1-1 meetings rationalisation

I’ve asked many teamleads why they have regular 1-1s.

By regular I mean set in the calendar to occur regularly.

Usual rationale is as follows:
- employees need time to bring and discuss problems they witnessed
- some problems need to be solved straight away and some can wait
- employees need not to be afraid to discuss problems
- manager need not to forget to provide feedback to employees

I’ll try to analyse each rationalisation attempt.

## Employees need time to bring and discuss problems

One cannot possibly argue that time is required to discuss a problem and come up with ways to solve it.

However, it’s important to focus on «when» the problem is discussed.



## Employees need not to be afraid to discuss problems

## Manager need not to forget to provide feedback to employees
