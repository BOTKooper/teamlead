# Quality of prognosis

When we say "feature A will take X days", we are providing a prognosis of time the team will spend to deliver the feature.

What do we take into consideration when providing such prognosis?

1. Uncertainty of the feature itself (we need to understand what the feature actually consists of)
2. Uncertainty of the world and people
