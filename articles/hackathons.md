# Hackathons considered harmful

Iâ€™m bedazzled how well the IT management manages to invent things which are awfully ineffective.

Wikipedia [says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon):

```
A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest, datathon or codefest; a portmanteau of hacking marathon) is a design sprint-like event

...

The goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event

...

Hackathons can last several hours to several days. For hackathons that last 24 hours or longer, especially competitive ones, eating is often informal, with participants often subsisting on food like pizza and energy drinks. Sometimes sleeping is informal as well, with participants sleeping on-site with sleeping bags.

...

There is sometimes a contest element as well, in which a panel of judges select the winning teams, and prizes are given.

I did a small study of hackathons mentioned on internet, and pretty much all of them have characteristics that Wikipedia mentioned:
- a set goal
- competition between teams
- lack of sleep
- no context switch, full focus on doing just one thing
