# Questions to ask the company

Planning to be interviewed? Prepare your list of questions!

If you think that your question should be here — send a PR.

## How does the company earn money?

- Is the company profitable?
- Does it live from investments?
- If yes, for how long will they last?
- Are new rounds planned?
- Will there be shares for the employees?
- How are they vested?
- What’s the business roadmap, plan and vision?

## What is your vision of a good employee? What do expect of them?

The interviewer must possess clear and non-contradictory understanding of what the employee should and shouldn’t do, and how to measure their performance.

## Who else will interview me and why?

Some companies have absolutely ridiculous multi-tier interview process, you should find it out in advance and decide if you’re tolerant enough to waste time on them.

## What was the reason of leaving of the last employee?

The way how managers handle firing/leaving is showing the culture much more transparently than any words on how much the company values people.

It might also be a good idea to ask for one of the leavers contacts and ask them how it all went.

## What might be considered a reason to fire me?

It’s always good to know what’s unacceptable.

## What is the staff turnover statistics?

If people leave a lot, more questions are to be asked.

Anyway, ask if the interviewer is satisfied with the current status quo and if not, what they are doing to improve the situation.

Good companies try to make sure employees work as long and productive as possible.

## How quickly is your company growing?

A company growing really quickly has a very distinctive atmosphere compared to stable ones. You need to make sure you need it (exponential growth never comes along with improving quality, see Amdahl's law).

## What is your organisational structure? How do people operate in it?

It's better to find out how complicated the org structure is.

Will you be required to travel? How often?

What are the rules of travel expenses reimbursement?

## What is the onboarding process?

Who will be my mentor?

It should be obvious that the company is interested in getting you to a full speed, so it should be a red flag if you’re just given code in a “go figure for yourself” way.

## How many other candidates are competing for this position?

Are you sure you want to "compete"?

## If some candidates were rejected, what was the reason for rejection?

The answer to this one might reveal something that wouldn't have been discussed otherwise.
