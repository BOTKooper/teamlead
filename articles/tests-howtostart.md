# How to start with autotests

As soon as you’ve [persuaded your manager](tests-persuasion.md) to support automated testing, you need to plan it right.

The easiest way to show the visible outcome to the managers is to show reduced TTM (Time to market) and reduced TCO (total cost of ownership).

TTM comprises of the time taken to pass all the steps required to develop and deliver certain functionality to the client.

Manual QA stage usually takes significant time: a feature awaits for the QA team to pick it for testing, then testing itself is done.

Autotests remove ‘awaiting’ stage altogether and decrease ‘testing’ stage time to the minimum.

This time reduction you should report to the manager.

## What to start with

The easiest way of starting from the technical standpoint is to cover found bugs with autotests.
