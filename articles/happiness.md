# Developers happiness

There are studies proving that unhappy developers are less productive and have higher risk of leaving the company.

I’ve seen so many teams where developers were unhappy and ‘forced themselves’ to work. This is counter-productive; and it’s our managers’ duty to make sure our teams are as productive as possible.

In this article I will review studies related to happiness and productivity and will try advising on how to get rid of things that are damaging your team.

## Happiness and the productivity of software engineers

The [overview study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332494069_Happiness_and_the_productivity_of_software_engineers) from Daniel Graziotin (Universität Stuttgart) and Fabian Fagerholm at Aalto University.

The study tries answering the big question — are happy developers more productive?

And it seems the answer is ‘yes’ — they are more productive when happy.

Now let’s see what the study shows as reasons for developers’ unhappiness.

To sum it up: **deadlines**.

Very rarely there’s a rational reason to have deadlines in software development, and even more, estimations at all. I would suggest you read [my article](estimations_en.md) or watch [my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqoJOEjeAEw) on the topic.

Simple advise here: think if you might get rid of estimations, story points or any other practice which only has negative effects on your team. If you’re specifically asked ‘when this feature;

> The third most frequent cause of unhappiness is to work with bad code and, more specifically, with bad code practices. Developers are unhappy when they produce bad code, but they suffer tremendously when they meet bad code that could have been avoided in the first place. As our participants stated, bad code can be a result of management decisions aiming to save time and effort in the short term.

To sum this on up: **broken professional ethics**

Martin Fowler has a very good [article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html) explaining exactly how ‘cutting costs’ on quality makes development more expensive.

So it’s a developer’s job (as a specialist in this area) to make sure the cost of development stays low, even if some manager asks to make it more expensive by imposing weird requirements.

This obligation to do the work properly is called professional ethics.

When a patient is having a surgery, no one is allowed to demand a surgeon to finish the operation sooner. Everyone respects surgeon’s work. Surgeon’s professional ethics rely solely on the surgeon’s professional judgement of how the operation is to be done for the best of the patient.

However for some strange reasons IT management often thinks that it’s up to them to decide when and how to write code, as if the management can actually predict the impact of reducing the quality in long term.

Advice here is simple too:
- managers: don’t ask or demand ‘to cut development costs’ or ‘ship it faster’ — if you do, you make the [TCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership) higher (development more expensive). Developers know better how to write code. If they don’t — get them some mentors.
- developers: stand for your professional ethics. If a manager asks you to cut the time — simply don’t. No one will fire you for that. Take your time to write quality code. This is what you’re hired for.

> Similar negative effects were mentioned regarding third persons (such as colleagues, team leaders, or customers) who make developers feel inadequate with their work, forced repetitive mundane tasks, and imposed limitations on development



> Several top causes are related to perceptions of inadequacy of the self and others
