# Developers happiness

There are studies proving that unhappy developers are less productive and have higher risk of leaving the company.

I’ve seen so many teams where developers were unhappy and ‘forced themselves’ to work. This is counter-productive; and it’s our managers’ duty to make sure our teams are as productive as possible.

In this article I will review studies related to happiness and productivity and will try advising on how to get rid of things that are damaging your team.

## Happiness and the productivity of software engineers

The [overview study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332494069_Happiness_and_the_productivity_of_software_engineers) from Daniel Graziotin (Universität Stuttgart) and Fabian Fagerholm at Aalto University.

The study tries answering the big question — are happy developers more productive?

And it seems the answer is ‘yes’ — they are more productive when happy.

Now let’s see what the study shows as reasons for developers’ unhappiness.

> Being stuck in problem-solving and time pressure are the two most frequent causes of unhappiness
> ...
> developers feel bad when they are stuck and under pressure, and several detrimental consequences do happen

> The third most frequent cause of unhappiness is to work with bad code and, more specifically, with bad code practices. Developers are unhappy when they produce bad code, but they suffer tremendously when they meet bad code that could have been avoided in the first place. As our participants stated, bad code can be a result of management decisions aiming to save time and effort in the short term.

> Similar negative effects were mentioned regarding third persons (such as colleagues, team leaders, or customers) who make developers feel inadequate with their work, forced repetitive mundane tasks, and imposed limitations on development

> Several top causes are related to perceptions of inadequacy of the self and others
