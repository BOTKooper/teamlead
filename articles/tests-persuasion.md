# How do I grow my manager to support autotests?

It's a widely accepted consensus that automatic tests (and TDD) benefit software development process in the following ways:

- saves time (reduce time to market) [link]()
- improve quality [link]()
- reduce stress [link]()
- reduce onboarding costs [link]()
- reduce total cost of ownership [link]()

Knowing all this, why do some managers still don't "allow" or discourage writing automated tests?

I witnessed the following reasons for this seemingly irrational behavior:

1. The manager doesn't see the rationality (i.e. the value) in autotests
2. The manager once was a very smart programmer, most likely an individual contributor. They either really managed to keep the whole program AST and context in their head, or, more likely, thought they kept it.
3. The manager has "number of features" as a KPI and they push the team to deliver as much as possible as soon as possible with little concern for quality
4. The organisation is structured so that there's a separate QA department and the manager there gets promoted when the headcount grows
5. The company is focused on preparing for selling and everyone wants to deliver as much as possible as soon as possible
6. The manager's individual motivation is "CV-driven": they aren't planning to stay long in the company but rather achive some quick (1-2 years) results and leave

What can we do in all these cases? How can we help ourselves deliver quality software?

First, we need to understand that people do not want to change their opinion, it's hard.

There’s a great [set of episodes of You Are Not So Smart podcast](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/) on one topic: [Backfire effect](https://effectiviology.com/backfire-effect-facts-dont-change-minds/).

Essentially, when you just come up to someone and present them facts proving that their opinion is wrong, this opinion might even get **stronger**.

> Essentially, when a person encounters information which suggests that their current beliefs are wrong in some way, they feel threatened, which causes them to generate a variety of negative emotions. This is especially likely when the beliefs in question are crucial to their self-concept, which means that they represent an important part of that person’s identity and ideology.
