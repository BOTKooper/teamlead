# Eudaimonia

> In its simplest (translated) form, eudaimonia is often taken to mean happiness (Deci & Ryan, 2006; Huta & Waterman, 2014; Heintzelman, 2018). Sometimes it is translated from the original ancient Greek as welfare, sometimes flourishing, and sometimes as well-being (Kraut, 2018). The concept of Eudaimonia comes from Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, his philosophical work on the ‘science of happiness’ (Irwin, 2012)

People can and should be happy—both at work and at home.

Scientists studied the importance of happiness at work, and I reviewed a few studies [here](https://github.com/sharovatov/teamlead/blob/master/articles/happiness.md).

The consensus is that unhappy developers are much less productive.

Factors that influence happiness or unhappiness are many; the top five include ‘boredom’ and ‘perception of the inadequacy of self.’

I think these factors have the same root — **people don’t understand the value of their work and their impact on delivering it**.

Nathaniel Branden in his book [The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Revolutionary Approach to Self-Understanding that Launched a New Era in Modern Psychology](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Psychology+of+Self+Esteem%3A+A+Revolutionary+Approach+to+Self+Understanding+that+Launched+a+New+Era+in+Modern+Psychology-p-9780787945268)
says:
> “No factor is more important in people’s psychological development and motivation than the value judgments they make about themselves. Every aspect of their lives is impacted by the way they see themselves.”

John C. Maxwell in his book [The 15 invaluable laws of growth](https://www.amazon.com/15-Invaluable-Laws-Growth-Potential/dp/1599953676) says on this topic:
> if you lack self-confidence—your self-esteem deficiency will limit you, no matter what other assets you possess
> people are never able to outperform their self-image

My thesis is that **people who don’t understand the value of the work and their impact on delivering it are much less happy and, therefore (as studies prove), much less productive**.

Two huge areas are exploring how to deal with this issue — [Narrative psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_psychology) and [Drama therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_therapy).

Both use storytelling and acting — essentially a dialogue with the audience to self-fulfillment and self-actualisation.

## Here’s what we offer:

A ‘speaking club.’

It’s a regular training aimed at improving employees speaking and acting skills, thus allowing them to:
- discover and reimagine themselves
- get rid of all the fears of the stage and start enjoying the dialogue with the audience
- explore the vast and unknown parts of the personality, finding true self through dialogue with the audience and themselves
- understand and see the value of things they do
- become a vital part of the global speakers’ community
- reduce time on preparing the talks
- come up with more engaging topics and ways to discuss them
- contribute to the company public perception and PR
- invest and improve personal brand image

As soon as people start giving more talks more confidently, they see better feedback from the audience, which leads to:
- their self-esteem growing, ‘impostor syndrome’ diminishing
- their productivity and loyalty to the company growing
- work getting more diverse and intense with events (different from a daily routine).

The feel and belief they are doing an amazing job and them being a great specialist grow with every single applause they receive at a conference.

They are even getting _smarter_ thanks to:
- speech and cognition deep connection (psycholinguistics elaborate a lot on this)
- every talk prep requires reflective analysis and synthesis phases (‘in order to learn, start teaching’ — there are multiple studies proving this effect: [#1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00028312019002237), [#2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361476X13000209), [#3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3410?campaign=wolearlyview)).

## The training procedure

This is a full-day offline group training event.

Group can have up to 8-10 people.

The program of the training is adaptive but comprises of two sinergetic activities: reflective and acting/speaking.

We create a psychologically comforting, trusting and empowering environment; then guide people through all the stages (finding a topic, working on it, presenting, testing and working with feedback, and finalising the topic).

We do not ‘pull’ the topics from people, we help people develop the skill to see and explicate meaning in what they do; and then we teach how to make it an appealing and moving narrative (or a different appropriate way to tell a story).

We can run our training in English and Russian.

8 hours schedule with a few breaks works well.
