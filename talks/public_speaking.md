## Why we should do this?

For me, things are usually done for one main reason: eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia means happiness, pleasure, welfare, etc.

Pleasure can be immediate, e.g.:
 - from creative activities — creating a piece of art, writing an article or coding
 - from consuming activities — reading a book, eating, taking a bath, etc

Pleasures can also be deferred or prolongated: like earning money, teaching a student, etc. — where the pleasure can happen or proceed later on.

Why am I saying all this?

Simple. If you work hard at a company you hate, even if you earn enough there, you are missing a whole lot of pleasure, you’re not living up to eudaimonia :)

To me the best job provides both immediate and deferred pleasure: I enjoy working and enjoy getting my salary.

What does a good job consist of?

For me it’s simple: good (smart and nice) people, great product, great salary.

Are you happy with all these three?

If not, what are you doing to improve one or all of them?

Before actually doing anything, you need to understand what and how you’re doing.

Can you influence your team members? Can you guide them, lead them by example?

Can you bring better people to your team?

And if you decide to quit and find a better company, how do you do this?

As usual, apply to many and see who wants you?

What if I say that you could do much better at the following:
- influencing your own team
- finding a better job
- having more eudaimonia while just working?

And all it takes — **just start being public**.
