## Why we should do this?

For me, things are usually done for one main reason: eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia means happiness, pleasure, welfare, etc.

Pleasure can be immediate, e.g.:
 - from creative activities — creating a piece of art, writing an article or coding 
 - from consuming activities — reading a book, eating, taking a bath, etc

Pleasures can also be deferred or prolongated: like earning money, teaching a student, etc. — where the pleasure can happen or proceed later on.

Why am I saying all this?

Simple. If you work hard at a company you hate, even if you earn enough there, you are missing a whole lot of pleasure, you’re not living up to eudaimonia :)
